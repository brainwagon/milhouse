Years ago, I read the book
[_One Jump Ahead](https://www.amazon.com/One-Jump-Ahead-Computer-Perfection/dp/0387765751)
by Jonathan Schaefer, which detailed his attempts to construct a program that could beat the World
Champion at checkers.  At that time, most of the effort in this kind of research was centered around
computer chess, but Schaefer decided to instead concentrate on checkers, which itself is an amazingly
interesting game with a significant backstory, including the story of Marion Tinsley, one of the most
amazing stories I've read in a long time.

I decided to use this as a project to learn more about alpha-beta game search.  This probably
isn't really considered "artificial intelligence" but it is fascinating to learn about.

It's now 2025, and I'm retired, and I've dusted off this code and am tidying up some of the loose 
ends that I've inevitably left on projects like this.  I've updated some of the code that 
I used for code generation in Python so that it runs in Python3, and made it build properly
and with fewer (eventually no) compiler warnings.  And, I have some additional ideas for improvement.
